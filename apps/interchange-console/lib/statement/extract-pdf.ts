// Official M-Pesa statements (emailed by Safaricom) are PASSWORD-PROTECTED. We
// use pdfjs-dist (legacy Node build) exclusively: it opens both encrypted and
// plain PDFs and reports password state precisely via PasswordException.
//
// NOTE: pdfjs-dist MUST stay out of the bundle (`serverExternalPackages` in
// next.config.ts). It resolves its worker with a runtime dynamic import; if the
// bundler rewrites that, pdfjs falls back to a "fake worker" and throws
// `Setting up fake worker failed`, which used to surface here as the misleading
// "Could not read this PDF" message.
//
// Server-only (Node runtime). Throws typed errors the route maps to friendly text.
