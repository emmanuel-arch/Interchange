// Ported from connected-suite/src/lib/statement/score-thinfile.ts on 17 Sep 2026 — the same engine the

// Uses the TRAINED logistic model once it has been fitted on enough real observed
// outcomes (isModelActive); otherwise falls back to the transparent EXPERT
// scorecard. Same input/output either way, so every caller is model-agnostic.
